    "\n",
    "The Capstone project is chosen from a Kaggle competition called the [Humpback Whale Identification challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whale-categorization-playground). Within the domain of this project, one needs to identify the species of the whale given a picture of it's fluke. This is a standard image classification problem from the field of Computer Vision and I plan to use Deep Learning Techinque called Convolutional Neural Networks to create or use an existing architecture. These networks have the capability to efficiently detect features in an image using convolutions as a technique, which can then be interpreted for a probability of a particular class the image belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in our case, the images of the fluke shall be the input to the network and as output there will be an array of probabilities with respect to the total number of classes. The class with the highest probability will be chosen for the task of classification."
